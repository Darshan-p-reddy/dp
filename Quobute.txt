OPEN SOURCE ASSIGNMENT

1.PROJECT REPORT ‘TERRA’

INTRODUCTION:-

1.SODA Controller:

•	SODA Controller is an open source implementation for all the control services (like metadata management, scheduler, other bookkeeping, utils etc) . 
•	This is currently added a separate repository considering many core services could be developed under this for the overall data store framework.
•	It is part of SODA Terra (SDS Controller). There are other two repositories part of SODA Terra viz., API and Dock.
•	In the API flow from SODA API to SODA DOCK, controller plays a critical role for all the API flow management and tracking to handle all the state machine and metadata management requirements. 
•	This will be a layer to keep addons to new services or facilities or utilities for the soda data platform. 
•	This is one of the SODA Core Projects and is maintained by SODA Foundation directly.
 

2.SODA Dock : 

•	SODA Dock is an open source implementation for the unified interface to connect heterogeneous storage backends.
•	So dock is a docking station for heterogeneous storage backends! This is where all the different storage vendors drivers for various storage backend models get attached.
•	SODA DOCK can interface directly to SODA API or via Controller.
•	The roadmap is to have multiple instances, multi-driver docks to support multi-cluster, multi-platform, or multi-cloud scenarios in the future.

3.SODA Api : 

•	SODA API is an open source implementation of SODA API Standards for Data and Storage Management. 
•	The effort is to provide a common unified data and storage interface to store, run any data anywhere.
•	This project implements the API Server, Different API services, utilities and more. 
•	The implementation will be based on the API standards from The SODA Foundation.
•	It connects the application or client to the storage backends to do data/storage management seamlessly providing a platform and storage agnostic framework.
•	Any application or client platform can implement the interface using the API specification to connect to API or implement northbound plugins to bridge their specifications to SODA API.

4.FEATURES:-
•	Standardized API, Controller for metadata and Dock for Drivers to provide seamless data management across various storage vendors
•	Supports to connect different platforms like Kubernetes, Open Stack, VMware through plugins
•	Supports custom vendors drivers and CSI plugins for heterogeneous storages

PROJECT ORGANISATION:-

SODA Foundation
•	 is an open source project under Linux Foundation that aims to foster an ecosystem of open source data management and storage software for data autonomy. 
•	IToffers a neutral forum for cross-projects collaboration and integration and provides end users quality end-to-end solutions.

2.Understanding Open Source

1.Introduction
•	Open-source software (OSS) is computer software that is released under a license in which the copyright holder grants users the rights to use, study, change, and distribute the software and its source code to anyone and for any purpose. 
•	IT may be developed in a collaborative public manner.
•	IT is a prominent example of open collaboration, meaning any capable user is able to participate online in development, making the number of possible contributors indefinite. The ability to examine the code facilitates public trust in the software
2.History
•	In the early days of computing, such as the 1950s and into the 1960s, programmers and developers shared software to learn from each other and evolve the field of computing,For example, Unix included the operating system source code for users.
•	Eventually, the open-source notion moved to the wayside of commercialization of software in the years 1970–1980. However, academics still often developed software collaboratively. Examples are Donald Knuth in 1979 with the TeX typesetting system[7] and Richard Stallman in 1983 with the GNU operating system.
•	In 1997, Eric Raymond published The Cathedral and the Bazaar, a reflective analysis of the hacker community and free-software principles. 
•	The paper received significant attention in early 1998, and was one factor in motivating Netscape Communications Corporation to release their popular Netscape Communicator Internet suite as free software. This source code subsequently became the basis behind SeaMonkey, Mozilla Firefox, Thunderbird and KompoZer.
3.Advantages 
•	Flexibility and Agility
•	Speed
•	Cost Effectiveness 
•	Ability to start small
•	Solid Information security
•	Attract better talent 
•	Shared maintenance Cost 


    3.SODA Foundation CHART

•	SODA (SODA Open Data Autonomy) is evolving to realize a challenging goal of building a unified framework for data and storage management.
•	It connects the application platforms and solutions to the backend storages seamlessly, be it on prem or cloud through a unified API layer. 
•	This enables the application platforms to focus on building more valuable use cases rather than worrying about managing the underlying storage backends and data management.
